First of all, I would like to thank my parents, Najeh and Latifa, for supporting me over the entire journey. Your support has been my foundation, allowing me, with freedom and peace of mind, to pursue this achievement. You have given me the gift of space to grow, study, and live my life without pressure or stress, and for that, I am and will forever be grateful. \newline

A heartfelt thanks also goes to all my friends, many of whom I've had the pleasure of meeting along this journey—some becoming closer, others less so. I won’t list them all, as I don’t want to forget anyone. You have been my safe haven, my source of comfort, and my support during the tough times—times that, thankfully, have been fewer thanks to all of you. I am truly grateful for each and every one of you. \newline

I would like to thank my colleagues at Alpenite, who over time have adopted me as part of their family. I have learned so much from all of you, and I deeply appreciate your support and understanding, especially during the studies tough moments. \newline

I want to express my deepest gratitude to Prof. Massimo Marchiori, my thesis supervisor, whose support has been pivotal in helping me reach the end of this journey. I am truly grateful for the patience and encouragement, which made this achievement possible. \newline

Lastly, I want to thank myself for not giving up all the times I thought about it.
