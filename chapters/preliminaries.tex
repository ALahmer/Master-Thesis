\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{chp:preliminaries}

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the foundational concepts, technologies, and frameworks that are essential for understanding the design, development, and functionality of the Social Media Kit (SMKIT) project. It includes a detailed exploration of web content analysis, social media automation, metadata extraction techniques like Open Graph, and the integration of these technologies with existing platforms. The chapter also introduces Negapedia, a platform that plays a central role in the specific implementation and use cases of SMKIT.
