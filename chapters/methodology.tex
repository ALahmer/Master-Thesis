\section{System Design and Architecture}
\label{sec:system_design_architecture}
This section explains the design decisions made for the Social Media Kit (SMKIT), including the overall system architecture, the key components that make up the system, and how these components interact to achieve the desired functionality. The system is designed to automate the generation and sharing of content on social media platforms, leveraging data from websites that integrate Open Graph (OG) tags or from the Negapedia website through a dedicated module for contextual analysis and content creation.

The architecture of SMKIT is based on a modular and scalable approach, allowing for flexibility in future development. Below are the key aspects of the system design:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Modular Architecture}: The system is built using a modular architecture, where each component or unit has a specific responsibility. This allows for easy maintenance and the potential for future upgrades. \begin{comment} The key components include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data Extraction Component}: Responsible for extracting data from external sources, such as websites with Open Graph (OG) tags or Negapedia specific data through web scraping.
        \item \textbf{Data Transformation Component}: Handles data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, converting raw data into structured and usable formats.
        \item \textbf{Content Creation Component}: Uses the processed data to automatically generate content for social media posts, including text and multimedia.
        \item \textbf{Social Media Posting Component}: Manages the process of posting content, previously extracted into structured and usable formats, to various social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) through the use of APIs.
    \end{itemize} \end{comment}
    
    
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: SMKIT is designed with scalability in mind. The system can handle multiple social media platforms and expand to include additional sources of data and content generation features. By using a modular structure, new components can be added without disrupting existing functionality.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Architecture Overview}
\label{subsec:system_architecture_overview}
The system architecture of the Social Media Kit (SMKIT) is designed with a modular approach to ensure scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance. The architecture integrates several key components that work together to automate the extraction, processing, generation, and sharing of content on social media platforms. Below is an overview of how these components interact:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Extraction Component}: The system begins by extracting raw data from external sources. This data extraction process can be achieved through web scraping, which provide the foundational content for further processing.

    \item \textbf{Data Transformation Component}: Once the raw data is collected, it is passed on to the data transformation component. This component is responsible for cleaning, structuring, and transforming the raw data into a usable format. It processes unstructured text to extract key insights, removes irrelevant or noisy data, and organizes the content into predefined formats.
    
    \item \textbf{Social Media Posting Component}: Finally, the transformed content is sent to the social media posting component. This component manages the process of sharing the content across various platforms like Twitter and Facebook, utilizing platform-specific APIs to ensure seamless posting.

\subsection{Technological Stack}
\label{subsec:technological_stack}
The SMKIT project employs a variety of technologies and tools to ensure efficient and effective implementation of its components. The system's design relies primarily on \textit{Python}, a versatile programming language, which serves as the backbone for the development of all key modules. Below is a detailed description of the key technologies used in the project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Python}: \textit{Python} was selected as the primary programming language due to its ease of use, extensive library support, and suitability for web scraping, data manipulation, and automation tasks. The SMKIT system is built entirely in Python, utilizing its powerful libraries for a variety of tasks, from data extraction to content generation and posting.
    
    \item \textbf{argparse}: For managing command-line interfaces, the project uses the \textit{argparse} module. This module simplifies the process of handling command-line arguments, enabling users to interact with the system via terminal commands for various operations permitted by SMKIT.

    \item \textbf{BeautifulSoup}: \textit{BeautifulSoup} is used for web scraping tasks, specifically for extracting metadata and content from external websites. It simplifies the process of navigating HTML structures and retrieving relevant data from web pages.

    \item \textbf{matplotlib}: For visualizing data, the \textit{matplotlib} library is employed to generate plots and diagrams. This is particularly useful for representing the anger and conflict-based metrics derived from data.
    
    \item \textbf{facebook-sdk} and \textbf{tweepy}: These libraries are used to integrate the system with social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, respectively. The \textit{facebook-sdk} allows for smooth interaction with the Facebook API for posting content, while \textit{tweepy} is used to manage content on Twitter. These libraries are integral in automating the process of sharing content on social media platforms, as discussed in Chapter 2.

\end{itemize}

Each of these technologies plays a vital role in the implementation of SMKIT, ensuring that the system operates efficiently, allowing for smooth data processing, content creation, and automation. The choice of Python, along with its extensive ecosystem of libraries, provides the flexibility needed to handle the diverse tasks within the system.

\subsection{Module Development for Negapedia Integration}
\label{subsec:module_development_negapedia}
The integration of Negapedia data into the Social Media Kit (SMKIT) system is handled by a dedicated module, developed to enable the extraction, processing, and posting of content related to Negapedia articles. This integration follows a modular approach, allowing the system to load and interact with different data sources based on user input.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Module Loading and Argument Management}: In SMKIT, the entry point is controlled via the command-line interface, using the \texttt{argparse} module to manage input parameters. A key parameter is \texttt{--module}, which specifies which data source module to load (e.g., \texttt{negapedia}). The system uses the \texttt{load\_module} function to dynamically load the appropriate module, ensuring flexibility and extensibility for future data sources.
    
    \item \textbf{Negapedia-Specific Input Validation}: When the \texttt{negapedia} module is selected, the system expects several mandatory input parameters, including \texttt{--pages}, \texttt{--post\_type}, \texttt{--mode}, and \texttt{--language}. These parameters are validated within the \texttt{handle\_module()} function of the Negapedia module. The function also includes checks specific to different posting modes, such as \texttt{summary}, \texttt{comparison}, and \texttt{ranking}, ensuring that the correct number of pages and ranking fields are provided before proceeding.

    \item \textbf{Data Extraction and Transformation}: Once the necessary parameters are validated, the Negapedia module extracts data from Negapedia pages, processing the content into a structured format, specifically a Python \texttt{TypedDict} called \texttt{NegapediaPageInfo}. This structure ensures that key information, such as words, conflict awards, polemic awards, and social jumps, is extracted and organized in a way that aligns with the system’s requirements. The amount of data to extract can be customized based on user input. The data transformation process then ensures that the raw Negapedia data, encapsulated in the \texttt{NegapediaPageInfo} dictionary, is usable for content creation and social media posting.
    
    \item \textbf{Post Settings and Customization}: The Negapedia module also allows customization of the posts to be generated. This includes setting the language, defining custom messages, and selecting the social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) where the content will be posted. The settings are passed from the command-line arguments to the module, ensuring that each post aligns with user preferences.

    \item \textbf{Post Settings and Customization}: The Negapedia module also allows customization of the posts to be generated. This includes setting the language and eventually defining custom messages. For each language, a specific template is used, which is particularly tailored for the Negapedia module. These templates are designed to handle and display specific data, such as conflict awards, polemic awards, and social jumps, ensuring that the content is presented in a contextually relevant way for the target audience. The settings are passed from the command-line arguments to the module, ensuring that each post aligns with user preferences and the unique structure of the Negapedia content.
\end{itemize}

In summary, the integration of the Negapedia module within SMKIT is designed to be flexible, allowing the system to process and post content from Negapedia based on user-defined parameters. The module's dynamic loading system, combined with robust input validation and data transformation capabilities, ensures that the system can effectively generate relevant and customized social media content.

\section{Data Collection and Preparation}
\label{sec:data_collection_preparation}
This section describes how data is gathered, processed, and prepared for use in the SMKIT system. The process involves extracting raw data from web pages using web scraping tools, cleaning the data to ensure quality and relevance, and transforming it into a structured format that can be easily used for content generation and social media posting.

\subsection{Web Scraping Tools and Techniques}
\label{subsec:web_scraping_tools_techniques}
The primary web scraping tool used in SMKIT is \textbf{BeautifulSoup}, a Python library that facilitates the easy extraction of data from static HTML web pages. BeautifulSoup was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling static content, which is all that SMKIT requires, as the system does not need to handle JavaScript-rendered content.
The tool is used to parse the HTML content of web pages, extracting relevant data such as text, links, images, and metadata, and structuring it for further processing. BeautifulSoup works efficiently with both the generic module and the Negapedia module, as both modules rely on static HTML pages that can be parsed directly, without requiring complex JavaScript handling.
This approach is well-suited for the needs of SMKIT, as it allows for the extraction of critical data points like page titles, descriptions, and specific metrics for Negapedia (such as conflict or polemic awards), which are then processed into structured formats.

\subsection{Data Cleaning}
\label{subsec:data_cleaning}
After the raw data is collected from web scraping, it undergoes a cleaning process to ensure that it is accurate, relevant, and in a usable format for further processing. The cleaning process varies slightly between the generic module and the Negapedia module, based on the type of data being handled.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generic Module Cleaning}: In the case of the generic module, the data is parsed and structured using metadata tags such as \texttt{og:title}, \texttt{og:description}, \texttt{og:image}, etc., along with any fallback values (e.g., page title or URL) if these tags are missing. While no direct filtering is applied, the content is organized into a \texttt{PageInfo} structure for consistent processing and usage.
    
    \item \textbf{Negapedia Module Cleaning}: For the Negapedia module, data cleaning is more complex. A helper function, \texttt{filter\_data()}, is used to filter the data based on several criteria, such as the type of data (e.g., conflict or polemic), the category of the content (e.g., "all" or specific categories), and the period of the content. The filter ensures that only the most relevant data is selected for further processing, excluding irrelevant or outdated entries.
\end{itemize}

The data cleaning process ensures that only high-quality, relevant data is used in the system, avoiding the inclusion of outdated or irrelevant content.

\subsection{Data Transformation}
\label{subsec:data_transformation}
Once the raw data is cleaned, it is transformed into a structured format that can be easily used by SMKIT for content creation and social media posting. This process involves converting unstructured or semi-structured data into well-defined data types, which can be processed by the system’s components.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generic Module Transformation}: For the generic module, the cleaned data is converted into the \texttt{PageInfo} data type, which is a \texttt{TypedDict} in Python. The \texttt{PageInfo} structure includes fields such as \texttt{title}, \texttt{description}, \texttt{message}, \texttt{images}, \texttt{urls}, and \texttt{updated\_time}, among others. This structured format allows for easy access and manipulation of the data within the system.
    \item \textbf{Negapedia Module Transformation}: For the Negapedia module, the cleaned data is transformed into the \texttt{NegapediaPageInfo} data type, another \texttt{TypedDict} in Python. The \texttt{NegapediaPageInfo} structure is more complex, as it includes additional fields specific to Negapedia, such as \texttt{historical\_conflict}, \texttt{historical\_polemic} along with \texttt{social\_jumps} and \texttt{words\_that\_matter}, among others. These fields capture detailed metrics and visual representations of conflict, polemic, and social interactions, making the data more specific to the Negapedia context.
\end{itemize}

In summary, the data collection, cleaning, and transformation process in SMKIT is designed to ensure that the system operates with high-quality, structured data that is ready for use in content generation. By utilizing web scraping, applying filtering techniques for data cleaning, and transforming the data into structured formats like \texttt{PageInfo} and \texttt{NegapediaPageInfo}, SMKIT is able to automate the creation of social media content that is both relevant and contextually appropriate.
