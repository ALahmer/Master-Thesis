\chapter{Results}
\label{chp:results}
This chapter presents the results of employing the Social Media Kit (\textbf{SMKIT}) in real-world scenarios. The evaluation is structured to highlight both the strengths and the limitations of the system, providing a comprehensive view of its effectiveness in automating the process of generating and sharing social media content.


\section{Objectives Met}
\label{sec:objectives_met}
This section discusses the aspects of the \textbf{SMKIT} that successfully meet the objectives and goals. It highlights the features that have been successfully implemented and provide the intended functionality.

The following objectives have been successfully achieved by \textbf{SMKIT}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Metadata Extraction}: \textbf{SMKIT} successfully extracts metadata from web pages, including key Open Graph tags such as \texttt{og:title}, \texttt{og:description}, and \texttt{og:image}. This feature has been thoroughly tested across multiple websites, ensuring accurate extraction and processing of data required for social media posts.
    
    \item \textbf{Content Creation}: The system is capable of generating posts for various platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and web pages. The posts are automatically formatted to meet platform-specific guidelines, ensuring consistency and correctness in terms of text length, image sizes, and other platform requirements.
    
    \item \textbf{Negapedia Integration}: \textbf{SMKIT} can generate posts specifically for Negapedia content. This includes generating summary posts, comparison posts, and ranking posts based on the data available in the Negapedia static pages. The system accurately processes Negapedia-specific data such as social interaction metrics and conflict-related data, ensuring high-quality posts for both social media platforms and web pages.
    
    \item \textbf{Social Media Integration}: The integration with the Facebook and Twitter APIs works seamlessly, enabling \textbf{SMKIT} to automatically post content to these platforms. The system correctly handles authentication and the posting process, ensuring that content is successfully shared with minimal manual intervention. The posts are also formatted to comply to each platform's specific content requirements.
\end{itemize}

In summary, \textbf{SMKIT} has successfully met the key objectives, demonstrating robust functionality in terms of metadata extraction, content generation for multiple platforms, and seamless integration with social media APIs.


\section{Requirements Not Satisfied}
\label{sec:requirements_not_satisfied}
This section identifies any aspects of the project that did not meet expectations or where the \textbf{SMKIT} did not fully satisfy the original requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform Limitations}: Issues with integration or limitations on certain social media platforms.
    \item \textbf{Incomplete Metadata}: Challenges with extracting specific metadata or handling incomplete data.
    \item \textbf{Formatting Issues}: Problems with platform-specific formatting or content layout.
\end{itemize}


\section{Limitations, Future Work, and Improvements}
\label{sec:limitations_future_work_improvements}
This section discusses the limitations of the current implementation and outlines potential future improvements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Limitations}: The CLI-based interface is not optimal for user experience; itâ€™s harder for less technical users to interact with the tool.
    \item \textbf{Future Work}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Adding functionality for calculating social post metrics (e.g., click-through rates, engagement).
        \item Implementing a \textbf{Graphical User Interface (GUI)} to improve the user experience.
        \item Expanding integration with additional social media platforms.
        \item Enhancing metadata extraction accuracy for more complex websites.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Improvements}: Improving error handling, optimizing performance, and adding more customization options for posts.
\end{itemize}


\section{Social Media Post Examples and Web Pages}
\label{sec:social_media_post_examples}
In this section, we present screenshots from real posts generated by \textbf{SMKIT}, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generic Post}: A standard post created using the generic template (Facebook, Twitter, Web Page).
    \item \textbf{Negapedia Summary Post}: A post summarizing content from Negapedia (Facebook, Twitter, Web Page).
    \item \textbf{Negapedia Comparison Post}: A post comparing two or more Negapedia pages (Facebook, Twitter, Web Page).
    \item \textbf{Negapedia Ranking Post}: A ranking-style post based on Negapedia data (Facebook, Twitter, Web Page).
\end{itemize}
Examples of these posts and web pages are shown below:

\section{Execution Timing Analysis}
\label{sec:execution_timing}
This section presents an analysis of the execution time for different post types and operations. We analyze the time taken for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Facebook Post Creation}: Time to generate and post content on Facebook.
    \item \textbf{Twitter Post Creation}: Time to generate and post content on Twitter.
    \item \textbf{Web Page Post Creation}: Time to generate and share web pages based on the same content.
    \item \textbf{Post Types}: Time comparisons for different types of posts, including generic, Negapedia summary, comparison, and ranking posts.
\end{itemize}


\section{Evaluation of Post Quality and Engagement}
\label{sec:evaluation_post_quality}
This section evaluates the quality and engagement of posts generated by \textbf{SMKIT}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Post Quality}: How well SMKIT adheres to platform-specific formatting requirements for Facebook, Twitter, and web pages.
    \item \textbf{Engagement Metrics}: Discusses how the posts performed in terms of likes, shares, comments, etc. (if available).
\end{itemize}


\section{User Experience (UX) Considerations}
\label{sec:user_experience}
This section reflects on the usability of \textbf{SMKIT}, particularly considering its current command-line interface (CLI):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CLI Usability}: The challenges of using the tool through a command-line interface for non-technical users.
    \item \textbf{Suggestions for GUI}: Discusses the benefits of developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience, accessibility, and ease of interaction.
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:results_conclusion}
This section summarizes the key findings of the Results chapter. It provides a final assessment of how well \textbf{SMKIT} met the project objectives and performs in real-world usage. The conclusion also provides a transition to the next chapter, offering a perspective on **Future Work** or **Conclusions**.
