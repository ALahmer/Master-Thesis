%This project aims to address these challenges by creating an automated, modular framework capable of analyzing web content, extracting relevant data, and posting it across multiple platforms with minimal human intervention. The goal is to provide a flexible tool that can adapt to the unique requirements of different websites and social media platforms, ensurings integration and effective content distribution. 
%Furthermore, the project also seeks to explore the potential for specialized automation modules, such as the one developed for Negapedia, to handle unique data types and presentation styles. This approach not only enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of content posting but also contributes to a deeper understanding of how automation can be tailored to specific online ecosystems.
The motivation behind this project rise from the need for a robust framework that can automate the extraction and analysis of web content and facilitate posting of tailored content on various platforms. While several tools and systems exist for social media automation, they often lack flexibility, modularity, or the ability to handle specialized websites with unique content formats.

SMKIT addresses these gaps by leveraging the Open Graph protocol to extract standardized metadata from various web pages which integrate this protocol, allowing for a more flexible and adaptable approach to automation. Specifically, this thesis develops a generic module capable of handling a wide range of web pages and a specialized module designed for the Negapedia website. By integrating Open Graph-based metadata extraction into the core of SMKIT, the project aims to provide a scalable solution that can automate content analysis and publication effectively.


\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem_statement}

\subsection{Defining the Problem}
\label{subsec:defining_the_problem}
The rapid growth of web content and the increasing importance of social media platforms have created a need for efficient, automated solutions to analyze and distribute content. However, the current tools and methods available for extracting meaningful metadata from web pages, analyzing this data, and posting content across multiple platforms are often inadequate or limited in scope. These tools frequently lack the flexibility to handle diverse content types and the ability to adapt to the constantly changing standards and practices of social media platforms.

The problem addressed in this thesis is the development of a comprehensive, modular framework that can automate the analysis of web pages and the posting of content on various platforms. This framework should efficiently extract metadata, such as Open Graph tags, and format it appropriately for multiple channels, including web pages, Facebook, and Twitter. Moreover, it should be adaptable to specialized websites with unique data structures, such as Negapedia.
